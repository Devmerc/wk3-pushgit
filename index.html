   			<h3>Contest for best tech site</h3>
   			<p>Do you hustle?  If you're like millions of people around the world, you don't have time to just surf the web to try find the latest tech trend.  Some sites are copy and paste jobs, but most have news so old you can't even catch the tail end of the wave.  Enter CutE (Cutting Edge) reviews.</p>
   			<p>We used an advanced multi-parametric algorithm took into account site visits, first to break tech news, most number of cited consumer product reviews, etc. etc. etc. (We can't tell you. Otherwise, it wouldn't be proprietary.)  Suffsice it to say, we didn't just ask our kids or the hipster at the cafe what sites we should include in this list. If our kids or the hipster is reading this, no offense.</p>
   			<p>Without further ado.  Here's what all the computing tecnology in the world spit out as the best sites:</p>
   		
   			<ol>
   				<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a><p>What can we say?  It's not just the uber-cool name meaning the "Art of Technology" that makes this site a winner.
